# About me

I am a postdoc at the Institute for High Energy Physics of Barcelona, Spain. My research revolves about a broad range of topics in Cosmology and Astrophysics, including the galaxy-halo connection, the cross-correlation of large scale structure and cosmic microwave background, photometric redshifts, and Lyman alpha forest.
