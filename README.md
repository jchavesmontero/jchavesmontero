### I am a postdoctoral appointee at the Donostia International Physics Center. My research revolves about a broad range of topics in Cosmology and Astrophysics, including the galaxy-halo connection, the cross-correlation of large scale structure and cosmic microwave background, photometric redshifts, and active galactic nuclei characterization.
