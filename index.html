        	<a href="http://dipc.ehu.es">Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)</a>. My research revolves around a broad range of topics in Cosmology and Astrophysics, including the galaxy-halo connection, active galactic nuclei, photometric redshifts, and cross-correlation of cosmic probes. My principal lines of work are:

			      Missing baryons</a>. A complete census of baryons in the late universe is challenging due to intergalactic gas's intermediate temperate and rarefied character. I use the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) to detect this gas, which refers to the Doppler boosting of CMB photons as these scatter off free electrons moving relative to the CMB rest frame. The motivation for using this observable is that the kSZ effect is sensitive to free electrons independently of the temperature and density of the medium in which these reside. Using the cross-correlation of the kSZ effect and angular redshift fluctuations, a novel observable presenting a tight correlation with the cosmic density and velocity fields, I set tomographic constraints on the abundance, location, and properties of intergalactic gas.

			      Forward-modelling galaxy colors</a>. The next generation of wide-field galaxy surveys will observe huge cosmic volumes, detecting hundreds of millions of galaxies with unprecedented precision. As a result, theory shortcomings and observational systematics will progressively become the primary source of uncertainty in large-scale structure studies. This problem is critical on small scales; these contain a wealth of cosmological information but are challenging to model due to non-linear couplings induced by gravity and the impact of baryonic processes. Motivated by this, I am working on forward-modeling galaxy observations to push large-scale structure analyses towards smaller scales while accounting for the impact of observational systematics.

			      Quasars</a>. Quasars are the brightest persisting sources in the Cosmos. Thanks to their great luminosity, we can detect them up to very high redshift, and thus quasars are ideally suited to conduct large-scale studies in the distant universe. My work revolves around detecting these sources in narrow-band photometric surveys and estimating their properties.

            Assembly bias</a>. A long-standing prediction of structure formation theories is that the clustering of dark matter halos only depends upon their mass. However, cosmological simulations show that their clustering depends upon multiple halo properties, including concentration, spin, and formation time; this effect is commonly known as halo assembly bias.  In principle, this effect could propagate into the clustering of galaxies due to the tight connection between galaxies and halos; this effect is referred to as galaxy assembly bias. I study the origin of assembly bias and its influence on the large-scale distribution of galaxies.
