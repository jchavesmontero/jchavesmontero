          I am a postdoct at the Institut de F&iacutesica d'Altes Energies
        	<a href="https://www.ifae.es/">(IFAE)</a>. My research revolves around a broad range of topics in Cosmology and Astrophysics, including the galaxy-halo connection, Lyman alpha forest and active galactic nuclei, photometric redshifts, and cross-correlation of cosmic probes. My principal lines of work are:

            Galaxy-halo connection</a>. The next generation of wide-field galaxy surveys will observe huge cosmic volumes, detecting hundreds of millions of galaxies with unprecedented precision. As a result, theory shortcomings and observational systematics will progressively become the primary source of uncertainty in large-scale structure studies. This problem is especially important on small scales because these contain a wealth of cosmological information but are challenging to model due to non-linear couplings induced by gravity and the impact of baryonic processes. I study the impact of galaxy formation effects such as assembly bias on cosmological observables, and I have recently shown that not modelling this and other effects results in significant discrepancies between observational measurements and theoretical expectations (lensing is low problem). To alleviate these problems, I am working on forward-modeling galaxy observations.

            Missing baryons</a>. A complete census of baryons in the late universe is challenging due to the intermediate temperate and rarefied character of intergalactic gas. However, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) is ideally suited to detect these baryons, which refers to the Doppler boosting of CMB photons as these scatter off free electrons moving relative to the CMB rest frame. This is because this observable is sensitive to all free electrons, independently of the temperature and density of the medium in which these reside. I used the cross-correlation of the kSZ effect and angular redshift fluctuations to set tomographic constraints on the abundance, location, and properties of intergalactic gas.

			      Lyman alpha forest</a>. Quasars are the brightest persisting sources in the Universe, and thanks to their great luminosity, we can detect these up to very high redshift. In its way towards us, quasar light interacts with intergalactic clouds of neutral hydrogen at different redshifts, producing a series of absorption features commonly known as Lyman alpha forest. I work on constraining cosmological models using this observable. I have also work on detecting quasars and measuring their redshift and mass.

            Assembly bias</a>. A long-standing prediction of structure formation theories is that the clustering of dark matter halos only depends upon their mass. However, cosmological simulations show that their clustering depends upon multiple halo properties, including concentration, spin, and formation time; this effect is commonly known as halo assembly bias. In principle, this effect could propagate into the clustering of galaxies due to the tight connection between galaxies and halos; this effect is referred to as galaxy assembly bias. I study the origin of assembly bias and its influence on the large-scale distribution of galaxies.
